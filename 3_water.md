# Water Finance

**New Approaches to Delivering Sustainable Water Infrastructure**


## Executive Summary

California’s disadvantaged communities (DACs) face a range of financial and staff capacity challenges as they work
to keep their aging water infrastructure and related systems fully maintained. These challenges are pitted against
an increasing need for environmentally resilient infrastructure that can meet the demands of rising populations
and uncertainty due to climate change. Unmet system needs include outdated drinking water treatment facilities,
incorrectly sized and leaking distribution pipe, low quality groundwater sources, crumbling wastewater collection
systems, failing wastewater treatment plants, stormwater management systems that fail to meet current weather
and regulatory conditions and localized flood mitigation hazards. Concurrently, decades of fire suppression have
left many northern California regions, and/or their vital water supplying watersheds, at risk of catastrophic
wildfire damage.

The public water sector has long relied on support from federal and state loan programs to fund new capital
projects or upgrades to existing infrastructure. Despite recent state bond measures and funding contributions
from the federal government, water infrastructure funding in California is perennially insufficient. Accessing new
capital is needed to jump start local projects. Alternative finance approaches which draw on private sector
financing, such as environmental impact bonds, community-based public-private partnerships and/or enhanced
infrastructure financing districts may provide California communities with additional opportunities to diversify
municipal funding portfolios for these vital projects, expanding upon or leveraging the loans and grants that water
agencies typically rely upon for capital projects.

We have prepared a guide, previewed here in this brief, for municipalities and disadvantaged communities
looking to strengthen and diversify funding sources to update and mange water infrastructure while meeting
environmental sustainability objectives. The guide examines a selection of environmental impact bonds, public-
private partnerships, and infrastructure financing district projects and suggests applications of these models
within California DAC water systems. In addition, the guide suggests a 9 step approach with supporting decision-
making tools: 1. Develop system understanding; 2. Apply options to the finance decision tree; 3. Create project
prioritization process; 4. Develop feasibility study; 5. Secure investment from diverse sources; 6. Implement; 7.
Measure outcomes and analyze results; 8. Communicate and share results; and 9. Iterate. Hypothetical
applications in the Sacramento River Funding Area are included. Recommendations to move projects forward
include creating regional scaling opportunities and establish self-sustaining funding sources and link capital
investments with projects, among others.

Innovative financing approaches are increasingly necessary if our communities and water agencies are to
implement the scale of adaptation projects needed in this era of increasing environmental and water supply
challenges, wildfire risk and stretched public budgets.

## WChallenges

Economically disadvantaged communities in Northern California, and their water utilities, face a range of water
infrastructure challenges. These challenges are increasingly exacerbated by the effects of climate change and
economic / demographic pressures.

### Drinking Water

While the paramount concern for many DAC water system operators is their aging drinking water infrastructure,
other communities rely on groundwater sources that have high levels of arsenic, nitrates or other contaminants.
These challenges are exacerbated by small ratepayer populations and perceived legal obstacles to rate or tax
increases that combine to make it difficult to raise sufficient revenue to fund replacement or rehabilitation of
failing systems through traditional budgetary approaches.

### Wastewater Treatment

Wastewater systems in DACs experience collection system breakages and disrepair that result in raw sewage
leaks and high maintenance costs. Outdated treatment systems may be inadequately sized to meet contemporary
demands and/or incapable of meeting current regulatory requirements. Wet weather infiltration into collection
systems increases treatment costs and leads to overflow events. As with drinking water systems, wastewater
operators are hamstrung by funding challenges, with inadequate rate revenue and traditional government
grant/loan opportunities insufficient to meet all needs.

### Stormwater Management

Stormwater management improvements are often lower priority projects for DACs due to the need to focus on
more critical needs associated with drinking water and wastewater compliance. Many urbanized areas struggle to
fund and implement stormwater management programs that meet permitting requirements for municipal
separate storm sewer systems and reflect green infrastructure best practices. Despite the high social, economic
and environmental benefits from implementing green stormwater management, the capacity and financing for
projects of this type is often lacking. Even when funding is available from state and federal sources, competition
for grants can be fierce.

### Watershed Health and Fire

Water agencies are increasingly concerned about the health of headwaters forests. Catastrophic wildfires and
their follow-on impacts can seriously threaten the security of these source waters, risks that can be mitigated
through forest thinning and restoration projects. Post-disaster projects often result in considerable avoided costs
while delivering additional benefits.

## Non-traditional Financing

Recognizing that public funding will never be sufficient to meet water infrastructure investment demand, there is
a growing interest in engaging the comparatively greater resources within the private sector. Private investors,
particularly impact investors, or investors committed to funding projects with social and environmental benefit,
collectively have access to more capital than government agencies. Private financing may be a pathway to
overcome funding limitations and implement community and watershed enhancement projects at a large scale.
This paper examines methods for attracting and utilizing private sector investments in public water infrastructure.

## Environmental Impact Bonds

Environmental impact bonds are a cost-share model that are specifically tailored to attract private investors who
are motivated by the social and environmental effects of their investments.

Whereas the primary goal of an environmental impact bond may be to achieve specific environmentally beneficial
outcomes, the investment may also create additional social, economic or environmental opportunities that
benefit the participating community. The performance payout may be tied to achieving local business
development, employment or poverty reduction goals.

## Cases

In the following section we review several of the growing number of environmental impact bonds that have been
successfully negotiated throughout the country. Most are still at the implementation stages, but they
demonstrate the broad applicability and flexibility of this potential solution to varying situations.

### North Yuba River

Blue Forest Conservation launched its first Forest Resilience Bond pilot in 2018, raising $4 million for a $4. million project to restore 15,000 acres of California’s North Yuba River Watershed. The repayment for the original investment came from reimbursable grants awarded by CAL FIRE, retained receipts from the US Forest Service, and a commitment from the Yuba Water Agency to make annual payments for 5 years (Figure 1). The structure of the Forest Resilience Bond offered a compelling investment opportunity and a chance to diversify CSAA’s and Calvert’s portfolio, especially as future bonds come
to market (Convergence, 2020).

### Colorado Wildfire Mitigation

Past fire suppression policies, drought conditions and beetle-infested forests have increased the threat of wildfire
Southwest Colorado. Quantified Ventures’ Wildfire Mitigation Environmental Impact Fund is utilizing funding from
private investors and revenues from biomass generated from forest thinning to offset the financial burden that
any one payor covers for wildfire mitigation in the San Juan National Forest wildland-urban interface. The project
creates the opportunity for scaling up forest treatments and fire reduction by creating a revolving loan fund that
reinvests proceeds into additional projects ensuring that capital
is available for long-term re-treatment and/or expansion of
forest health interventions.

### Green Infrastructure Bond

The City of Atlanta’s Department of Watershed Management
worked with Quantified Ventures to develop a publicly offered
environmental impact bond in January 2019. The first of its kind,
the bond secured $14 million for regional scale green
infrastructure projects intended to reduce stormwater-related
flooding in the city’s economically disadvantaged Proctor Creek
neighborhood. The bond’s ten-year term and base interest rate
of approximately 3.6% will allow the City to make a significant
upfront investment in projects that are calculated to deliver $
million in environmental and economic benefits derived from
reduced flooding and increased water quality.

### Baileys Trail System

The Baileys Trail System is a proposed 88-mile, premier mountain biking trail system in Athens County, Ohio, in
the Wayne National Forest. Through increased visitation, the trail system is proposed to revitalize one of the
poorest and most underserved counties in Ohio. Private investment is providing the upfront cost of building trails
with repayment tied to the successful achievement of the economic development outcomes, in this case
increased sales tax and transient guest taxes (Quantified Ventures, 2018).

## Public Private Partnerships

In addition to environmental impact bonds, other methods for attracting private capital may be suitable for SRFA
DACs. A particularly interesting model in the stormwater management and stream restoration arena is a
community-based public-private partnership. Community-based public private partnerships take the well-
established public-private partnerships model and modify it by tying payment to achievement of environmental
and social outcomes that benefit the community and increase stakeholder engagement in project delivery
(Adaptation Clearinghouse, 2020).

### Salinas

In 2019, the City of Salinas took Initial steps to set up a thirty-year Design-Build-Finance-Operate community-
based public-private partnership. This program is intended to implement and maintain green stormwater
infrastructure to meet stormwater permit requirements. Metrics for performance include quantitative
environmental and social metrics that will serve as the performance measures for the Partnership. The City is
planning an initial investment of $50 million depending on the establishment of a stormwater utility, or
alternatively a cohesive, low-cost and responsible financing approach.

### Prince George’s County

In March 2015, Prince George's County, Maryland created the Clean Water Partnership, a community-based public-private partnership to retrofit up to 4,000 acres of impervious surfaces using green infrastructure features (Figure 2). The
Partnership provides up to 40% of the County’s compliance costs upfront, enabling projects to begin sooner and removing much of the reimbursement challenges typically encountered with public funding. It also greatly reduces the County’s administration and procurement costs by up to 80%. The agreement requires small and minority-powered businesses to be contracted for up to 40% of the total project, creating a projected 5,000 jobs.

## EIFDs

Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts (EIFDs) are a recent evolution of the tax increment financing tools previously
developed in California. They support financing infrastructure projects with anticipated increased property tax
revenues associated with the future benefits of the projects (Lefcoe, 2014). Revenues from Enhanced
Infrastructure Financing Districts can be used for public works, transportation, parks, libraries and water and sewer facilities—with an emphasis on sustainable community
goals under California’s landmark climate legislation (Flint,
2018 ). Recent revisions to the Enhanced Infrastructure
Financing District law reduced some of the challenges to
adoption; for example, no public vote is required to establish
a District. With this new flexibility available, developing an
Enhanced Infrastructure Financing District may be a
particularly useful tool for funding regional projects that
benefit multiple agencies or jurisdictions (CSDA, 2019).
Indeed, revenues gathered through an Enhanced
Infrastructure Financing District may be one option for
repaying the investment used to secure an environmental
impact bond.

## Lessons into Practice

Adopting a suitable approach for a specific set of projects will be critical to the success of developing a new environmental impact bond or other suitable financing approach. Ideally, the process of determining an appropriate financing approach begins early, with an effort to fully articulate the relationship between the water-related challenge faced by the utility and the outcomes the utility seeks to attain. An initial feasibility study can be tailored to identify the full suite of benefits and beneficiaries associated with a water infrastructure project. Collaboration is a key ingredient in building a successful financing package − water system investments should not be thought of as stand-alone projects undertaken solely by a water agency but as partnerships between the agency, members of the community and an appropriate portfolio of investors.

A partnership approach is essential to assembling a portfolio of diverse funding and financing sources. Agency and
non-profit partners may be eligible for state, federal and philanthropic grants. Partners with sufficient financial
resources may be able to carry up-front costs while waiting for government reimbursement grants. Private
beneficiaries may be able to provide debt financing with favorable repayment terms. A portfolio approach also
allows water agencies to identify revenue streams that are appropriate for each investment provider. For
example, water rates may be used to repay state-provided loans while improved instream flows or reduced flood
risk may have monetary value for private sector investors.

In general, we suggest that project developers follow an iterative process infused by collaboration and
partnership, that consists of the following steps:

1. Develop system understanding
2. Apply options to finance decision tree
3. Create a project prioritization process
4. Develop feasibility study
5. Secure investment from diverse sources
6. Implement projects
7. Measure outcomes and analyze results
8. Communicate and share results
9. Iterate (return to step 1)

>SACRAMENTO REGION EIFD
In 2017, the city of West Sacramento
became one of the first California cities
to take advantage of the new Enhanced
Infrastructure Financing District law. The
City’s Enhanced Infrastructure Financing
District covers approximately one-
quarter the area of West Sacramento
and is expected to generate revenues of
$1.1 billion for parks and recreational
spaces, sewage and stormwater
infrastructure improvements and other
projects that foster community
revitalization and sustainability.


## Hypotheticals

With these broad concepts in mind, the case studies presented above suggest several example applications of
non-traditional financing to actual project needs. Water resource agencies and their communities will benefit
from considering private investment approaches either to complement public sources of funding or to make up
for unavailable public funds. The following table summarizes these examples.

## Recommendations

What might municipalities, DAC water systems and others do to move a project or program forward and
overcome key obstacles or challenges? We offer the following recommendations:

1. Create regional scaling opportunities. Collate watershed wide programs for regional funding and projects and
    avoid creating bespoke environmental impact bonds for every city or jurisdiction.
2. Facilitate multiple community water system consolidation. Consolidation does not necessarily need to apply to
    an entire water system. It could be for joint water treatment chemical purchase to reduce costs as well as
    sharing technical knowledge, capacity and economies of scale to implement prioritized projects.
3. Diversify funding sources. Create opportunities, capacity and finance for small communities to easily develop
    new funding sources beyond loans and grants while still strengthening their ability to secure the latter.
4. Establish self-sustaining funding sources. As environmental impact bonds are created and successful, build a
    sustainable funding portfolio that takes advantage of multiple private and public funding sources as well as
    grants vs. revenue generation. Self-sustained funding could also be based on the community foundation
    model.
5. Develop regional innovation centers for new capacity, tech and funding. Regional centers could include
    training, access to funding and new technologies related to water infrastructure and restoration. An
    innovation center could also attract people to work in DAC communities.
6. Create a clear and defensible case for investment. Quantified Venture’s work building the case for bonds and
    revolving loan funds is instructive here. In each project they made the case to investors and implementers for
    the appropriate finance tools but also completed the due diligence to analyze the investment risk.
7. Increase collaboration, transparency and information to maximize replication and mitigate risks. Collaboration
    creates stronger programs across multiple partners and increases scale and transparency. Tell your
    neighboring towns and counties how you are solving these problems!
8. Standardize metrics for measurement. There are catalogs to help standardize sustainable development goal
    metrics and these are becoming more accessible and easier to use. IRIS+ is the generally accepted system for
    managing, measuring and optimizing impact.
9. Link capital investments with projects. Conservation finance experts have commented that funding is not the
    problem delaying investment for environmental projects, but instead there are billions of unallocated
    investment resources undeployed due to lack of projects (Hamrick, 2016).
10. Establish alternative finance as a value-driver instead of value-added tool. For example, as the market for
    assets such as carbon credits continues to gain traction and grow, forest land managers interested in non-
    timber forest revenue still view alternative finance sources as a value-add rather than a value driver (Bilhorn,
    2020 ).
