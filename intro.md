# Introduction

Welcome to the Northeast California Conservation Finance Book. The articles in this book and the underlying pilot project were originally supported by a California Department of Water Resources Integrated Regional Water Management Disadvantaged Community Involvement, Technical Assistance grant provided to the Yuba Water Agency. They have been updated and modified to apply to the Northeast California CALFRAME OPR project ({numref}`Figure %s <neca_aoi>`).

The foundational document to this series, [Because It's Worth It](https://srfadacip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Because-Its-Worth-It_final.pdf), spawned the additional articles and chapters contained in this book.

## Conservation Finance

With the wild swings in public fund availability businesses, nonprofits, and agencies are looking for sustainable funding models and approaches that leverage both public and private investments in natural resource conservation and infrastructure. 

Conservation finance offers a groundbreaking approach to securing long-term, sustainable finance to landscape scale conservation and forest health projects. It fosters collaboration between private and public sectors, generating sustainable funding streams. This innovative strategy achieves multiple goals:

- Channels capital into forest management projects that offer overlapping ecological, social, and financial outcomes.
- Attracts private investment by quantifying ecosystem services to create a value proposition for beneficiaries, who in turn will pay for these benefits.
- Utilizes partnerships to strengthen the financial foundation for restoration, reforestation, and post-fire recovery.
- Reduces the burden on public budgets.
- Increases the pace and scale at which these initiatives are completed.
- Enables the long-term protection of forests and related natural resources, ensuring their invaluable benefits persist for future generations.[^1]
