<p><strong>A Roadmap for Accessing Private Investment to Support Fire Risk Reduction and Recovery, Forest Health and Watershed Restoration in Northern California.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="executive-summary">
<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<a class="headerlink" href="#executive-summary" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The Burney-Hat Creek Community Forest and Watershed Group is a collaborative forestry and watershed restoration effort dedicated to improving social, environmental, and economic conditions in the Burney Creek and Hat Creek watersheds. The Fall and Pit River Resource Conservation Districts are working on the California Forest Residual Aggregation and Market Enhancement (CalFRAME) Pilot Project to aggregate feedstock so that existing and emerging businesses can secure long-term contracts for forest wood products. That project area will cover northeastern CA, including Shasta, Lassen, Modoc, and Siskiyou, Counties. A sub-committee of the Collaborative convened to create a finance roadmap to outline the paths that leverage public and private funds to meet priority project needs for both the Collaborative and the CalFRAME pilot. This document proposes a Conservation Finance Roadmap to support the eventual delivery of public and private finance to support multi-benefit forestry, watershed, and economic development projects. The Roadmap describes the processes linked to creating conservation finance strategies, barriers to arranging private finance, potential solutions to these challenges, resources, recommendations, and next steps for the subcommittee.</p>
<p><img alt="Shape1" src="RackMultipart20240328-1-i56soj_html_dea25a1a13f92d71.gif" /></p>
<p>Key takeaways gleaned during the process include</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A <strong>blend of public and private funding</strong> is needed to accomplish the projects identified in the region at the scale and pace that best responds to emerging risks and opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identifying payors</strong> willing to invest in projects based on the value of avoided costs continues to be a challenge for conservation finance development.</p></li>
<li><p>Tried and tested experience with <strong>wood products operations AND finance</strong> are critical to success for forest management and wood utilization infrastructure operations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendations include</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>The region’s recommended model for conservation finance includes funding from private investors, foundations, state, and federal sources</strong>. The model includes consideration of additional funding through forms of public and private investment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>An alternative to the full model</strong> would be to complement state and federal funding sources with revenue from payments for the benefits of restoration, forest health management, or mitigation projects, such as the Avoided Wildfire Emissions Protocol.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A centralized administration entity</strong> could play a critical role in managing public grants, contracts, environmental compliance, and private funds. This entity could be housed at one of the RCDs, a local nonprofit, or be created as a new entity to manage funds and administration for any entity, private, public, or individual landowner, implementing forest practices.</p></li>

<h2>BACKGROUND<a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This Roadmap is intended to provide support to the Fall River RCD and its partners as they plan, secure financial support for, and implement forest health and watershed restoration projects in northern California. This report and the conversations that informed it “nest” against several ongoing planning and implementation efforts in the region, including the Burney Hat Creek Community Forest and Watershed Group, the California Office of Planning and Research Forest Residuals Aggregation Market Expansion (CalFRAME), and individual projects planned by the Fall and Pit River RCDs. To develop this Roadmap, the authors worked with Fall River RCD staff to form a finance subcommittee of the Burney Hat Creek Collaborative. The Collaborative, FRAME feedstock pilot, Burney-Hat Creek Finance sub-committee purpose, and roadmap development process are described in the following paragraphs.</p>

<p><img alt="Shape2" src="RackMultipart20240328-1-i56soj_html_af2cbd7cec5f3539.gif" />In recent decades, local northeast California communities have experienced high rates of unemployment and increased risks of high-severity wildfires, issues the Collaborative actively works to mitigate. The Burney Hat Creek Community Forest and Watershed Group (<a class="reference external" href="https://sierrainstitute.us/program/bhc/">BHC</a>), founded in 2009, is a collaborative forestry effort dedicated to improving social, environmental, and economic conditions in the Burney Creek and Hat Creek watersheds. The Collaborative footprint encompasses 364,250 acres of public, private, and Tribal lands and the communities of Burney, Johnson Park, Hat Creek, Cassel, and Old Station (Figure 1). The Lassen National Forest manages approximately 58 percent of the collaborative footprint, 29 percent is owned by large private forestland owners, seven percent is managed by Lassen Volcanic National Park, and four percent by large ranches, Tribal trust, and allotment lands.</p>
<p>The group’s vision is to create a fire-resilient forest ecosystem with sustainable populations of wildlife, fisheries, and habitat, functioning and restored watersheds and water quality, protected cultural resources, and appropriate recreational opportunities while also helping to support quality of life, jobs for diverse community members, and economic benefits in local communities. Post-fire recovery following large wildfires, such as the 2021 Dixie Fire, shows the challenges of protecting forests, water supplies, and communities and the need for increased investment to reduce fire risk and create healthier, more resilient forests and watersheds.</p>

The project area will cover northeastern CA, including Shasta, Lassen, Modoc, and Siskiyou Counties (Figure 1). Numerous small and industrial businesses are working to sustainably manage California forests in the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) and wildlands within this geography. The goal is to develop community and ecological resilience, particularly considering California’s trending increase in high-intensity catastrophic wildfires (Figure 2). The Dixie Fire in 2021 burned nearly one million acres and was the largest single, non-complex fire</p>

<h2>Problem<a class="headerlink" href="#problem" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>One of the key limitations to developing and implementing large-scale forest and watershed restoration projects is the difficulty in arranging appropriate amounts and types of financial support. Limited financial resources impede the implementation of large-scale forest restoration projects, particularly as the economy waxes and wanes. However, a large pool of untapped sustainable private investment capital could be deployed to help close the gap between natural resource management needs and available financial support. For example, impact, or outcome-based private investment, which pairs water and resource agencies with community partners and private capital investors in an outcomes or performance-driven partnership, is a promising approach that connects public water agencies to a new, non-traditional source of project financing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many water agencies and communities lack familiarity with these concepts, and the novel financing structures translate into a perception of elevated risk. Coupled with high start-up costs, often limited staff capacity, and other institutional or socioeconomic constraints, the barriers to successfully implementing these vital projects can be too significant for agencies to overcome independently (<a class="reference external" href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!AiNZQdXTGgyZgpAxUh_8EkLChuNCQw">Macejko, Russell, and Odefey, 2021</a>).</p>
<p>Members of the BHC face several challenges in developing a conservation finance strategy to support their forest and watershed restoration projects:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Lack of internal staff capacity and expertise</p></li>
<li><p>Uncertainty about the process for developing a conservation finance strategy</p></li>
<li><p>Poor connectivity to private finance options</p></li>
<li><p>Uncertain public agency response or support</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This paper is intended to address at least the first two of those challenges and has implications for improving the second two.</p>
</section>
<section id="barriers">
<h2>Barriers<a class="headerlink" href="#barriers" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Northeast California is renowned for its natural beauty and recreational opportunities, from high mountains to world-class streams and lakes. Sparsely populated and rural, many towns are economically disadvantaged. They face an acute lack of capacity and limited access to funding to address natural resource challenges faced by fire, restoration, and associated infrastructure.</p>
<p>A California-wide study on forest restoration and wood utilization found barriers to private financial investment include heightened risk for investors given unpredictable supplies, increasing costs, lack of markets for low-value biomass and lack of local infrastructure and capacity (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Branching-Out.pdf">Elkind et al., 2022</a>). When identifying their biggest obstacles in preparing for and responding to wildfires, 38% of respondents cited barriers related to inadequate funding to cover base program operations, administrative time, and costs (<a class="reference external" href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d7fbfdd7fed606396f41e20/t/5e384e18be55567743848f37/1580748323320/RFFC_CapacityNeeds_web.pdf">Davis et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p>Additional barriers to forest restoration, rural development, and infrastructure include</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Decreased private investment in local business and economic development. With limited local economic capacity, local businesses and community organizations are constrained in their ability to attract and manage investment in natural-resource-related enterprises. Without addressing the gap in sustainable and stable funding for local community organizations, the disparity in state and federal funding allocations to vulnerable communities will continue to grow.</p></li>
<li><p>Across the nation, private investment in water and forest infrastructure and restoration barriers include securing project payors, understanding and allocating acceptable risk, and quantifying and measuring outcomes (<a class="reference external" href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=4201540284AEF10B&amp;amp;id=4201540284AEF10B%211081&amp;amp;parId=4201540284AEF10B%211018&amp;amp;o=OneUp&amp;amp;sw=bypassConfig">Odefey and Russell, 2022</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Episodic, short grant funding periods and fragmented funding for projects undermine organizational momentum of plans and projects, organizational capacity, and the ability to develop innovations and achieve impact at scale.</p></li>
<li><p>Private landowner assistance is underfunded; at the same time, it is becoming increasingly important. These properties make up the heart of the wildland urban interface, particularly in rural areas such as NE California, and are at significant risk of catastrophic wildfire (Tompkins personal communication, 2022).</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="funding">
<h2>Funding<a class="headerlink" href="#funding" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Funding is a partial solution to several barriers to implementing forest restoration projects. However, rather than focusing on individual funding sources and types, developing strong financial mechanisms that collate a portfolio of funding for any project, program, or landscape may be a higher priority. We have organized this section to be brief and organized to flow from the more traditional funding types to non-traditional and less well-established. The Roadmap is not meant to be a definitive funding guide source; rather, we describe funding and investment resources, including the grant roster developed by project proponents, that may be considered, along with descriptions of non-tradition funding sources.</p>
<section id="grants">
<h3>Grants<a class="headerlink" href="#grants" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>As part of the Burney-Hat Creek Collaborative roadmap development, partners created a <a class="reference external" href="https://onedrive.live.com/edit.aspx?resid=4201540284AEF10B!1164&amp;amp;ithint=file%2Cxlsx&amp;amp;authkey=!AO6SyBvcTE3aImk">Grant Program Roster</a>. The roster is designed to sort funding opportunities by agency, grant focus, and type of organization using filters to narrow the funding opportunities. Currently, the list is comprehensive for state and federal resources. Philanthropic sources will be added in the future. The roster is complementary to the larger but more general state funding database. This tool has proven to be a useful shortcut through the maze of public agency funding programs.</p>
</section>
<section id="loans">
<h3>Loans<a class="headerlink" href="#loans" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Loans are often used by public, private, and nonprofit entities to cover the initial costs of projects, payroll, or material costs when awaiting reimbursement from state and federal grants or investing in or augmenting a business. The pluses of loans are availability, rapid deployment, and low-interest rates. The minuses are debt servicing, the ability to pay back when returns are low, do not exist or are not possible for certain projects, and inaccessibility for entities without an established track record. Loan programs that can be subsidized and managed by public agencies (e.g., GoBiz) have a role in easing access to capital for equipment and infrastructure purchase. A zero- to low-interest loan program could be instrumental in delivering forestry and wood products utilization machinery to the Burney – Hat Creek communities.</p>
</section>
<section id="taxes-fees">
<h3>Taxes/fees<a class="headerlink" href="#taxes-fees" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Taxes, measures, and fees can effectively raise consistent revenue over longer periods. In 2020, for example, Marin County approved Measure C to fund wildfire prevention and preparedness efforts. The resulting 10-year parcel tax levies <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.10/building ft2 providing nearly \)</span>20 mn/yr to prevent and mitigate wildfires in Marin County managed through the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.marinwildfire.org/">Marin Wildfire Prevention Authority</a> Joint Powers Agreement. Raising taxes can be challenging for rural communities without a strong commercial and private housing real estate market. California law requires voter approval of new or increased taxes. However, when tied to re-investment in the community, tax proponents may succeed in making a case for a temporary assessment.</p>
</section>
<section id="payments-for-ecosystem-services">
<h3>Payments for Ecosystem Services<a class="headerlink" href="#payments-for-ecosystem-services" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>State and federal grants for conservation, wildfire mitigation, and restoration are indirect payments from the public for ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. In any given region, however, the public’s willingness to pay for additional benefits may often be voluntary, e.g., a GoFundMe campaign or a specialized nonprofit that funds and works to protect a local trail system, a charismatic local species, or a historical monument. However, more organized campaigns may be structured or codified into local or regional policies based on voluntary contributions (e.g., dollar check-off programs). These are often successful in areas that have tourism without entrance fees. One example is the National Forest Foundation’s Ski Conservation and Forest Stewardship <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nationalforests.org/grant-programs/stewardship-funds">Fund</a>. Funds come from voluntary guest contributions at ski areas or lodges operating on National Forest System Lands. They must go to restoration projects in the forest where the ski area is located. An opt-out approach works best in these scenarios, e.g., a contributor must uncheck a box to indicate they do not want to contribute.</p>
<p>Larger watershed contribution programs throughout the west combine public and private funds to protect water resources and fund restoration or fire mitigation projects. Typically, these funds are more successful when close to larger urban areas, such as the Salt River Project and the Northern Arizona Forest <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nationalforests.org/who-we-are/azforestfund">Fund</a>. A similar approach could be taken in the Burney-Hat Creek through a regional fund that adds $1 to room nights in all hotels, Airbnb rentals, and outdoor recreation businesses. Another approach would be to connect hunters and anglers who regularly visit the region and are interested in restoring forest, riparian, and other associated habitats.</p>
</section>
<section id="corporate">
<h3>Corporate<a class="headerlink" href="#corporate" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Corporate contributions to environmental sustainability are increasing to respond to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, increased corporate responsibility focus, and links to dependence on natural resources. Funding from corporations can often be a long haul, is heavily dependent on connections within corporate sustainability offices or executive suite officers and may not be similar in size to grants to foundations and public funding sources. However, corporations often offer additional resources in addition to funding. Patagonia, for instance, offers modest grants of approximately $30,000 but also gives access to their communications and media departments to grantees. Corporations are highly interested in payments for ecosystem services and quantifiable outcomes. The parametric insurance example mentioned below is an example where corporate entities have been involved in funding restoration projects that also protect business assets and may offer avoided cost savings or a return on investment.</p>
</section>
<section id="philanthropic">
<h3>Philanthropic<a class="headerlink" href="#philanthropic" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Philanthropic foundations can play key roles in the development of conservation finance strategies for forest and watershed restoration by providing grants or other investments in the projects or in the organizations that undertake them. Foundations can operate at regional and national levels; across these sectors there is considerable interest in supporting projects that increase climate resilience, boost workforce and economic development, and sustain rural communities. Foundation support may come in the form of grants to cover operating expenses and project development activities by the RCD or a similar project administrator. Some foundations also provide investments, known as Program Related Investments (PRIs) or Mission Related Investments (MRIs) for which they generally expect a below market rate or nominal interest return.</p>
<p>It’s notable that the RCD has experience with support from the McConnell Foundation which made a $300,000 grant to support a high priority WUI restoration project. Grants of this nature can provide initial funding which can be leveraged to obtain additional investments in projects or programs.</p>

<section id="finance-strategies">
<h2>Finance Strategies<a class="headerlink" href="#finance-strategies" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Blended financing strategies that assemble a diverse portfolio of funds from public grants and add private resources can be key to creating a locally appropriate and collaborative finance portfolio. We believe these strategies may support forest and watershed restoration projects undertaken by BHC and economic or community development efforts that can support those restoration projects.</p>
<section id="collaborative-finance">
<h3>Collaborative Finance<a class="headerlink" href="#collaborative-finance" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Collaborative finance is a conservation finance strategy that involves cooperative interaction between individual project developers, stakeholders, and finance providers. This process may or may not include traditional financial institutions (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.collaborativefinance.org/">collaborativefinance.org</a>). We broaden the term to include finance developed by fair and equitable participation of stakeholders in a region, landscape, or watershed to address natural resource and infrastructure management needs, utilizing multiple forms of funding from public grants to private investment. Finance approaches may include outcomes-based finance models such as environmental impact bonds. For a deeper discussion of collaborative finance approaches to financing water infrastructure in California, see American Rivers’ <a class="reference external" href="https://www.americanrivers.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Water-finance-paper-final-layout-3.pdf">Because It’s Worth It</a> white paper. The BHC workgroup, and potentially the FRAME project, have many aspects of collaboration that can be directed to developing suitable public-private financing for restoration projects.</p>
</section>
<section id="environmental-impact-bonds">
<h3>Environmental Impact Bonds<a class="headerlink" href="#environmental-impact-bonds" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>One outcome of a collaborative finance strategy may be the development of an environmental impact bond. In 2017, Quantified Ventures and the District of Columbia’s Department of Water and Sewer (DC Water) launched the nation’s first environmental impact bond focused on implementing green infrastructure to reduce sewage overflows and flooding (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.conservationfinancenetwork.org/2021/09/27/pioneering-environmental-impact-bond-for-dc-water-updated">Martin and Appelbaum, 2021</a>). This outcomes-based investment package tied the rate investors earned to achieving specified environmental performance goals. The investment package structure linked DC Water to private bond buyers. The structure used by Quantified Ventures, DC Water, and their investors follow the track illustrated below. Noteworthy in this outcomes-based repayment scheme is the role of the third-party evaluator. Five years after launching the project, the evaluator confirmed that stormwater runoff had been reduced by nearly 20%, a level that met the Bond’s base-level repayment criteria (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.quantifiedventures.com/dc-water-eib-results">Lindsay et al., 2021</a>).</p>
<p>Blue Forest Conservation’s <a class="reference external" href="https://www.blueforest.org/forest-resilience-bond">Forest Resilience Bond</a> adopts a different approach. The Bond, more of a revolving loan instrument, is not, strictly speaking, an outcomes-based financing strategy. The payor for the project, Yuba Water Agency, makes payments to investors that are not linked to achieving any of the project’s many benefits. The structure adopted by Blue Forest enables the creation of a portfolio of investors and funders who repay and complement the agency’s funding.</p>
</section>
<section id="eifds">
<h3>EIFDs<a class="headerlink" href="#eifds" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts (EIFDs) are a recent evolution of the tax increment financing tools previously developed in California and support financing infrastructure projects with anticipated increased property tax revenues associated with the future benefits of the projects (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.planningreport.com/2014/07/24/demise-tif-funded-redevelopment-california">Lefcoe, 2014</a>). Revenues from Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts can be used for public works, transportation, parks, libraries, and water and sewer facilities, emphasizing sustainable community goals under California’s landmark climate legislation (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.lincolninst.edu/publications/articles/hidden-costs-tif">Flint, 2018</a>). Recent revisions to the Enhanced Infrastructure Financing District law reduced some of the challenges to adoption; for example, no public vote is required to establish a District. In 2017 the City of West Sacramento created a new Enhanced Infrastructure Financing District that is expected to raise $1.1 billion for parks, stormwater, sewage, and other infrastructure improvements. While a more appropriate vehicle for cities and urban populations due to the housing density, it is possible that broad landscape-scape districts could be adapted to more rural areas such as northeast California.</p>
<p>However, EIFDs are heavily reliant on anticipated increases in property tax revenues. Given the lack of urban populations in NE California and an immediately apparent connection between restoration projects and increase private property values in the WUI, it is not immediately apparent whether this approach can benefit the region.</p>
</section>
<section id="revolving-loan-funds">
<h3>Revolving Loan Funds<a class="headerlink" href="#revolving-loan-funds" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Pooled funding sources such as impact bonds or revolving loan funds can help end the project-&gt;project funding cycle with greater funding available and at larger scales. Typically offered at lower than market interest rates, revolving loan funds are self-replenishing pools of money utilizing principal and interest payments on existing loans to issue new loans. They have been used effectively from small to large-scale to develop businesses, assist healthcare, and improve environmental outcomes. They are flexible and can be used with more conventional funds such as grants and loans and have been used for decades in developing and developed countries.</p>
<p>For example, through a coalition of public and private partners, the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.swifproject.org/">Southwest Wildfire Impact Fund</a> intends to utilize resources from private investors and revenues from biomass generated from forest thinning to offset the financial burden for wildfire mitigation in the San Juan National Forest wildland-urban interface. The project fosters regional collaboration through shared project financing and implementation. It also creates the opportunity for scaling up forest treatments and fire reduction by creating a revolving loan fund that reinvests proceeds into additional projects ensuring that capital is available for long-term re-treatment and expansion of forest health interventions.</p>
<p>Because of its revolving loan nature, the impact of the fund will continue to grow over time as capital is redeployed for forest health treatments in new areas beyond this initial plan. The Environmental Impact Fund will deploy financing for an initial proposed plan to reduce wildfire risk over 64,871 acres in Southwest Colorado, encompassing private, federal, state, local, and tribal lands. An analysis of three representative parcels within the larger proposed geography demonstrated a benefit-cost ratio of nearly 300% based on avoided risk and damage to properties, infrastructure, and water resources if a wildfire were to occur. In addition, an estimated 287,708 green tons of biomass would be made available through the treatments, which can be converted to electricity or other commercial uses if biomass plants can be built to consume the woody by-products of forest restoration projects.</p>
<p><img alt="Shape5" src="RackMultipart20240328-1-i56soj_html_7f5d8fcc6f998782.gif" />Blue Forest Conservation’s<a class="reference external" href="https://www.blueforest.org/forest-resilience-bond">Forest Resilience Bond</a> adopts a different approach. The Bond, more of a revolving loan instrument, is not, strictly speaking, an outcomes-based financing strategy. The structure adopted by Blue Forest enables the creation of a portfolio of investors and funders who repay and complement the agency’s funding. The payor for the project, Yuba Water Agency, makes payments to investors that are not linked to achieving any of the project’s many benefits.  Blue Forest is also developing a larger Revolving Fund that would be capable of supporting multiple projects, scaling up the Forest Resilience Bond without custom tailoring investment packages for each project. This emerging fund could be a major source of funding for BHC without requiring as much pre-development work by the RCD or partner. Such a multi-project fund could greatly ease the burden and cost of conducting a feasibility study and greatly increase funds available for forest restoration and wood utilization projects.</p>

<h3>Avoided Wildfire Emissions<a class="headerlink" href="#avoided-wildfire-emissions" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Spatial Informatics Group and Element Markets are developing a forecast methodology under the Climate Forward program to recognize the climate benefits associated with fuel treatment activities that lower the risk of catastrophic forest fires and their emissions. Known as the <a class="reference external" href="https://climateforward.org/program/methodologies/avoided-wildfire-emissions/">Avoided Wildfire Emissions Forecast Methodology</a>, the final product is expected by June 2022 and could provide complementary funding for thinning and prescribed fire projects to grants and private investments. The Protocol differs from carbon offsets in that forecasted mitigation units, known as FMUs, are issued for forecasted greenhouse gas reductions or removals. FMUs are used to mitigate anticipated future emissions, such as wildfires. FMU credits were created today to address future impacts and equal one metric ton of CO2e. Thomas Buccholz of the Spatial Informatics Group gave the committee an overview of the Protocol on May 17, 2022.</p>

<section id="parametric-insurance">
<h3>Parametric insurance<a class="headerlink" href="#parametric-insurance" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Parametric or index-based insurance covers the probability of a predefined event instead of indemnifying actual loss incurred (<a class="reference external" href="https://corporatesolutions.swissre.com/insights/knowledge/what_is_parametric_insurance.html">Swissre, 2018</a>). These so-called trigger events are typically disaster (e.g., wildfire, flooding, hurricane, earthquake) related and measured through triggers such as wind speed, quake magnitude, or rainfall amount. Insurable triggers must happen by chance and are modeled. When the triggers are reached, a predetermined pay-out is made regardless of the sustained physical losses. Parametric insurance is meant to complement existing indemnity insurance but is increasingly used for post-disaster restoration funding in the natural world. One of the earliest examples of its use for nature recovery is the Mesoamerican Reef parametric insurance that provided $800,000 for reef restoration following Hurricane Delta. The trigger was windspeed with a parameter greater than 100 knots. The funds came from the Coastal Zone Management Trust (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/newsroom/coral-reef-insurance-policy-triggered/">Winters, 2020</a>). Using insurance to protect natural areas and their communities may be a unique way to connect public and private finance at an ecosystem scale.</p>

On the forestry side, the focus has been on forestry practices, wood products, and biomass utilization, focusing on initial projects that can reduce wildfire threats. Financing zero or low-interest loans for biomass infrastructure is a distinct possibility. Recent calls with these entities indicate there is high interest for IBank and GoBiz to become more involved in the region, particularly to support finance related to equipment and infrastructure.</p>

<h3>Fintech &amp; Blockchain<a class="headerlink" href="#fintech-blockchain" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Technology in the financial realm is already revolutionizing the investment world. Blockchain technology could help finance projects, connect payors to them, and provide collaborative digital platforms that connect funders to implementers and hastens pace and scale. With rapid iteration from finance to project and a community that governs and builds a permissionless system through open, collaborative, and equity-based protocols, the forest restoration blockchain system could rapidly evolve if the technology can be deployed, tested, and widely adopted. In other words, this is an unproven resource but rapidly changing and worth watching. It has mostly been applied to reforestation and carbon sequestration projects. Let’s look at how it might work.</p>
<p>The Open Forest Protocol has a five-step approach for reforestation (adapted from <a class="reference external" href="https://openforestprotocol.medium.com/a-look-ahead-at-2022-for-ofp-381a8b74c584">Kelly, 2022</a>):</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Forested land plots are registered at an online protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Remote sensing and ground-truthed data are gathered, recorded, and analyzed in an online map portal. Spatial and monitoring project data is stored permanently in an open distributed blockchain ledger, which is merely a shared database spread across multiple sites, regions, or participants.</p></li>
<li><p>Independent validators use remote-sensed data, ground surveys/monitoring, or drones to ensure data legitimacy.</p></li>
<li><p>Forestation projects gain transparency and trust through monitoring and validation.</p></li>
<li><p>Operators have access to carbon, reforestation, and restoration financing when projects meet outcomes and are successful.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Blockchain can be utilized further through smart contracts, an automated contract that executes when specified events, actions, deliverables, or other terms are met. Some of these concepts get applied to planning and permitting in a centralized one-stop shop, but that is outside the scope of this Roadmap.</p>
<p>How does this work for funding, however? Let’s examine a hypothetical case based on platforms we know are currently being developed (Figure 3). In this case, the following steps are taken for listing a project that will create carbon credits:</p>

<li><p>A project implementer designs a project that a neutral third party or agency vets. The project proponent is given access to the listing engine and generates a project file.</p></li>
<li><p>A carbon rating company accesses the project file. The company then issues an investment recommendation.</p></li>
<li><p>If approved, the project file goes to the investor pool. A limited review period, e.g., 30 days, ensues</p></li>
<li><p>After the investor review, an auction for a portion of the carbon credits occurs among pool investors.</p></li>
<li><p>The project is listed on the exchange if the auction clears the reserve price. Successful bidders get tradable carbon credits, and the project proponents receive upfront funds from the portion of the carbon credits to initiate the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Project reporting ensures quality, transparency, and successful projects.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Recommendations<a class="headerlink" href="#recommendations" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>While the influx of funding from state and federal sources is welcome and more is needed, current federal and state funding levels are temporary, with a five-year closeout of most Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocations and (likely) state budget shortfalls in coming years. As such, there is a continuing imperative to leverage those funds with private capital. Public funds may not last, may change focus, and are historically cyclical. Private investment strategies can complement public grant/loan funding to create composite portfolios of financial support for the accelerated implementation of landscape-scale restoration and mitigation projects. Despite this opportunity, private capital investment in forest and watershed restoration is negligible to non-existent in many regions. Yet, because private businesses are impacted by fire and drought or other natural resource disasters, there is increasing recognition across the corporate and investment sectors that they can play a role in supporting forest and watershed health projects.</p>
<p>Creating clear, quantified metrics, feasibility studies, and the business case written in a business language is one critical key to connecting the private sector. Another may be state agencies acting as a broker for supply, such as the OPR feedstock pilot or GoBiz connecting private investment at scale to local efforts. Overcoming the challenge of connecting implementers with investors is a key challenge. This relationship-building challenge may be partially overcome with investment platforms, securing public funding, and creating better markets for wood products. The recommendations section offers a model and options for a way forward conceptually that will need boots on the ground and additional funding to solve.</p>
<p>The following broad recommendations are offered, followed by a more specific model description of what a forest health fund could look like for the region.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Prioritize and bundle projects to create funding economies of scale and specific project funding that match the multiple benefits of forest health and fire mitigation.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a blended finance approach to fund projects. The blended approach includes matching public grants with private funds and adding marketable forest product sales, carbon credits, and forecasted mitigation units created through thinning and prescribed fire projects enrolled in the future Avoided Wildfire Emissions Protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Raise funds for a feasibility study. Studies cost approximately $100,000 but are a central document for stakeholders and investors to secure project funding needs.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="prioritized-pathways">
<h2>Prioritized Pathways<a class="headerlink" href="#prioritized-pathways" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The Collaborative could pursue three predominant pathways, with the third (full model) being the preferred pathway (Figure 4):</p>
<p><img alt="Shape6" src="RackMultipart20240328-1-i56soj_html_f927746e8c68aa3.gif" /></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Grants</strong>. Pursue business as usual with loans complementing existing grant funds. Although large amounts of grant funding are becoming increasingly available through block grants and new programs, this model will likely change with changing state and federal funding over time. A grants-only approach does not leverage private funds or smooth the peaks and valleys of funding availability over time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Grants Plus</strong>. The Avoided Wildfire Emissions Protocol and potential carbon offset sales could create meaningful but small funding availability that could complement grant funding sources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Full Finance Model</strong>. The full model would complement public funds with private investments, the emissions protocol, and a project platform connecting funders and investors to project implementers (Figure 5, Figure 6). This option is the highest priority pathway to pursue, but given its complexity, need to connect to investors, and size, it will take much more time and effort to develop.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The restoration and forest/watershed health projects contemplated by the BHC could be effectively advanced through a blended finance strategy that builds on the Forest Resilience Bond model developed by Blue Forest for public lands in the North Yuba River watershed. This project-focused investment may also complement additional financing and grant funding that supports purchasing forestry and mill equipment, job training, and administrative capacity to manage the overall financing strategy. We will take each of these resources in turn.</p>

<h2>Forest Health Fund<a class="headerlink" href="#forest-health-fund" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>To visually capture the Burney-Hat Creek roadmap and based on feedback from multiple committee members and colleagues, we developed a Burney-Hat Creek Forest Health Fund model based on a fund that reaches $20 million in capitalization (Figure 5). The figure is read from left to right, starting with a feasibility study and project proposals to private and public funding sources. Initially, the Fund is capitalized by private investment and is small but grows over time as additional investments and grants are secured.</p>
<p>A key component of the administration of the fund is the Program Administrator. The Administrator would be a regional entity, possibly a nonprofit or Resource Conservation District, that oversees fiduciary management of the fund and contracts and acts as the liaison with private entities and public agencies. The Administrator could hire in-house staff as grant writers, mostly specialists in navigating state grants but capable of assembling applications to federal agencies and foundations.</p>
<p>Another key factor in the model is the verification of outcomes. Metrics need to be broadly applicable across projects and not wholly dedicated to a single investor to increase administrative efficiency and establish success measures to compare metrics and outcomes across projects at multiple scales. The project outcomes would be developed together with funding agencies and investors. Once projects near completion, an independent verifier would evaluate the projects, and if outcomes are reached, payments would be triggered and made by the Fund payors. Ideally Payors have a vested interest in the outcomes that are avoided costs related to their operations. For example, they could be an insurance company interested in reducing the risk of wildfire to homes and keeping home insurance rates low or a private timber company interested in protecting their timber from a wildfire initiated on public lands.</p>
<p>We envision the following steps in capitalizing and implementing the fund over time:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Collaborative works identify the existing funding situation and solution process, culminating in a feasibility study with predetermined outcome metrics.</p></li>
<li><p>Initial funding comes from state and federal grants ($10.2 million, 20% covers administrative costs).</p></li>
<li><p>Additional funding comes from private sources (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5M private investors, \)</span>3m concessionary grants, and gifts).</p></li>
<li><p>The Project Futures Platform provides a steady, up-front source of income through auctions of carbon credits or other marketable ecosystem services.</p></li>
<li><p>The Avoided Wildfire Emissions Protocol creates forecasted mitigation units (FMUs) based on each planned project or grouping of projects.</p></li>
<li><p>When state grant expenses are reimbursed, the invoiced funds are returned to the fund by the program administrator (minus 20% overhead)</p></li>
<li><p>When project outcomes are met and verified, an outcome trigger creates a payment return to investors from the project payors. It generates payments for mitigation units from the Avoided Wildfire Emissions protocol.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is often difficult to follow how the money flows in a fund. We added a finance ledger to show the hypothetical movement of funds through a 3-year cycle (Figure 6). The ledger demonstrates how initial capitalization from private sources can launch the fund and leverage funds from public sources. The start-up funds from private resources allow the expenditures proposed for public funds and cover the delay in the time it takes from expenses to reimbursement from state and federal sources.</p>

<h2>Next Steps<a class="headerlink" href="#next-steps" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The Burney-Hat Creek finance roadmap is the initial step in creating a funding portfolio for projects identified in the CalFRAME pilot for NE California and/or the BHC collaborative forest plan. A clearer picture will develop as the pilot’s project list is refined and the funding needs are identified. At the same time, the finance subcommittee must continue contacting funders, private and public, and funding processes, such as the project futures platform, that could make a critical difference in funding projects as time progresses. These steps will be instrumental in taking the Forest Health Fund Model from theory to practice. The following next steps could include</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Create a full, prioritized projects list with accurate planning and implementation costs and secured funding. Project prioritization could include raising funds to conduct a Burney-Hat Creek Forest Health Forest Fund. The estimated cost of a study is approximately $100,000.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue efforts to obtain grant support from state and federal funding agencies for projects, program administration, and equipment purchase.</p></li>
<li><p>Undertake outreach to potential financial service providers, e.g., Blue Forest, Corvias, Environmental Impact Partners. This may include co-developing a blended finance strategy.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Develop funding for and implement a project futures platform.</p></li>
<li><p>Participate in the avoided wildfire emissions protocol</p></li>
<li><p>Continue regular meetings of the finance work group to progress the funding narrative and needs and connect to private investors. Revise and update an annual funding strategy according to project needs and funding gaps.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An actionable timeline to complete these steps is shown in Table 1.</p>
