# NECA

## Background

1. Why this chapter and approach
2. What's feasible for northeast CA?
3. How to make the JPA financially stable/sustainable?
4. JPA complements RCD, private entities (e.g., LTOs), and other organizations working on wood utilization in the region

## Realistic options

1. **Endowment**. Create an endowment from OPR funding tranche (plus other contributions) invest it conservatively. Interest/gains from the principal fund the JPA
    1. The seed funding for the JPA is $2mn
2. Contributions. McConnell Foundation, individuals, other private gifts.
3. **Federal and State Grants**. Unlikely that JPA will get operational funding from state and fed grants, but any proposals that it leads or participates in, could charge overhead (usually 10-15%) plus directly bill salaries to cover some operating costs.
    1. NICRA
4. **Member Contributions**. RCD and other feedstock aggregation members pay $5k/yr to participate in the program. This would be unrestricted funding for the JPA.
5. **Fee for Service**. Example of Western Shasta RCD work with nonindustrial forest owners, provide services for forest mgmt plans with small forested LOs (The State funds the development of FMPs, but landowners cannot secure funds to implement the plans). JPA could create a similar service offering. Need to make sure it's not competing with other RCDs in the region.
6. **Sort yards**. See pag 6 highlights for costs. Need to do a feasibliity study for this to work.

## Temporal Adoption

1. New finance options, such as environmental impact bonds, could be introduced over a longer time-period and trialed at a small scale, then scale up when successful.
2. Other revenue generating options could be tested in the same manner to make sure they work and also introduce them to skeptical participants, financial managers, or government entities that are not used to working with alternative finance options.
  
## Hypothetical budget

1. Todd spitballed a budget of $300k/yr based on similar operating expenses for RCDs in the region.
2. It could be with lower costs due to the JPA isn't initially managing projects like the RCDs are possible.
3. Provide a budget example and discuss potential shortfalls or gaps.
4. Insurance costs at <3% of budget
 
## Next steps

1. Timeline or GANTT chart for financial implementation
2. Feasibility study?
