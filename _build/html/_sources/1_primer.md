**Understanding New Models for Accessing Private Investment**

---

## Background
With passage of the Infrastructure Act in Congress, and the uncertain prospects of the Build Back Better Act, there has been much attention on federal funding for the nation’s infrastructure. Water systems, including investments to improve drinking water health and security, wastewater and stormwater systems, and natural infrastructure stand to benefit from this infusion of money. However, underneath this apparent largesse lurks a different truth – over 85% of all investments in our communities’ water infrastructure comes from local sources - people like you and me paying our taxes and water bills to our local water agencies. Chronically underfunded, these agencies can benefit not just from infusions of public funds from DC and state capitals, but from smart, innovative financing strategies that leverage private investments to help local funding work harder.

A parallel news cycle highlighted the increasing appeal of environmental impact bonds and similar outcomes- based approaches to financing water infrastructure. The City of Buffalo just closed on the nation’s largest environmental impact bond, bringing in $49 million to help that city overcome flooding and pollution problems with green infrastructure installations on private property. In California, Blue Forest Conservation and the Yuba Water Agency recently launched a second Forest Resilience Bond, delivering another $25 million to forest and watershed health projects in the Northern Sierra. What makes these approaches compelling? How do they work, and what benefits can they provide? This document hopes to clear up some of the mystery around the financing strategies by:

- Clearly describing collaborative project finance
- Unpacking the roles played by participants in these strategies and the structures that deliver private investment to projects
- Providing examples and lessons learned from existing finance collaborations

## Why Private Finance?

Impact investment, outcomes-based finance packages, private-public partnerships, and other strategies to access private capital are, in some ways, variations on a time-tested model for accessing the capital needed to fund community infrastructure. Many water agencies have traditionally issued bonds to borrow the money needed to finance sewer systems, water treatment facilities, and other hard infrastructure. Debt-financing these investments has many advantages, including immediate access to the full amount of money needed for projects, reduced upfront costs compared to paying cash for projects, and inter-generational equity that spans repayment across the lifespan of the project. In addition, debt financing may reduce impacts on water rate payers. 

Our partners at the WaterNow Alliance point out that if a utility with a $70 million annual budget were considering investing $10 million in a major GSI incentive program, the utility would have to raise rates 14% to pay for the program out of its annual operating budget. If instead the utility debt-financed the program and paid for it over 20 years, less than a 1% rate increase would be needed to implement the same $10 million program.[^1]

## Benefits of Private Finance

- Matches investment-ready capital with on-the-ground restoration projects that yield environmental and social returns.
- Accelerates the pace and scale at which restoration work can yield these dual returns by raising funds upfront and decreases the time for project completion from decades to 2-3 years.
- Stabilizes otherwise irregular funding from public sources, allowing work to move forward more rapidly and predictably, significantly aiding cash-poor non-profits and municipalities in starting and completing projects.
- Builds local capacity and greatly eases the contracting burden across project proponents.
- Can be structured to re-distribute the risk for project design and success away from payor and toward implementer (e.g., via a pay-for-performance approach.)

Compared with traditional debt financing, “non-traditional” strategies to access private investment offer some advantages, particularly for smaller and mid-sized water agencies. First, many of these strategies can transfer risk from the water agency and public to private investors and investment facilitators. What do we mean by this? Initially, approaches such as the partnerships developed by Corvias, place the responsibility for financing and delivering infrastructure projects on the private sector. Sometimes referred to as private-public partnerships or Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Transfer project delivery, this approach can reduce burdens on water agency staff and open finance opportunities when agencies lack expertise and capacity to directly engage private investors.

Risk can also be transferred by lining repayment rates to the success of the project; in essence, a water agency is committing to pay for the benefits of a project rather than for the project itself. An interesting example is the Bailey’s Trail System Environmental Impact Bond which is delivering a mountain biking trail network to a rural community in Ohio.[^2] Repayment of this investment isn’t linked to completion of the trails but to the expected increase in community economic activity in the local community. This economic uplift was the purpose of the project and financing.

Another benefit can come from using private investment to leverage multiple funding sources, creating a portfolio
of funds that can repay the initial investment. The North Yuba Forest Resilience Bond is an excellent example of a
debt-finance structure that combines private and public funds to accelerate and scale-up watershed health
projects. Finally, private investment strategies may be accessible for green infrastructure and natural
infrastructure projects that may otherwise have limited access to federal and state funding and financing
programs, such as State Revolving Loan Funds. Impact investment bonds have successfully delivered green
stormwater infrastructure projects in Atlanta, the District of Columbia; the North Yuba Forest Resilience Bond is
leveraging multiple investments to deliver forest restoration work across tens of thousands of acres in a fire-
threatened California watershed.

## Private Investment in Action

There isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to developing a locally relevant private finance strategy, but some key elements appear in many of the pioneering examples in this field. At a most basic level, private finance of water infrastructure requires relationships between _stakeholders_ or _beneficiaries_ who can participate in the planning and initiation of
projects. These beneficiaries may be _investors_ in the project; however, _investors_ may be an entirely separate set of entities.

Ultimately, the central role is played by the agency or agencies who are the primary payors for the project. Payors are responsible for the repayment of all debt, including any interest on borrowed money. _Payors_ may be able to draw upon rate or tax revenues and other sources of income to repay the _investors_. In the water sector, payors may be motivated by the need to comply with regulations or other legal mandates, the obsolescence of outdated infrastructure, or the need to respond to emerging conditions or threats. For community groups or other non-agency proponents of a project, establishing a partnership with a payor is instrumental to the success of most financed projects.

Let’s take these roles in turn.

Collaboratives. Often, successfully planned, financed, and implemented projects succeed because they are
informed and supported by a collaboration of affected beneficiaries or stakeholders. These individuals and
organizations can ground a project in the needs of the surrounding community, contribute expertise and
perspectives that inform project design and implementation, and contribute social capital that leads to political
support for the project. This support can translate into opened opportunities for funding, investment, and other
forms of support.

Investors. Federal or state agencies may contribute partial funding for a project or provide various forms of
financing support such as credit guarantees, credit enhancement or loss reserves, or technical assistance.
Investors can come from many sectors. For instance, insurance companies, retirement funds, university
endowments, and institutional investors may offer below-market interest rates if a project meets their
environmental or social benefit goals. Individual impact investors, acting alone or through composite funds, may
be willing to provide capital at reduced rates of return to environmentally or socially beneficial projects. Finally,
philanthropic foundations may be available to invest in projects that fulfill their programmatic interests. One
benefit of private finance strategies is the potential to blend multiple investment sources into one project
portfolio, perhaps even sequencing these sources of financing to discrete phases of a project.

Payors. Ultimately, projects must be paid for, and investors repaid for the financing they provide. Often, this
repayment obligation will fall on a public water agency, or other governmental body, with an operational or
ownership interest in the proposed project. Agencies with a regulatory or other driver that compels their interest
in the benefits of a project will be the most ‘secure’ payors. However, other forces may motivate agencies,
institutions, even businesses to pay for (or contribute toward) the outcomes associated with a successful project.
Corporations with sustainability, resilience, or environmental justice commitments are equally driven to invest in
projects that provide beneficial outcomes. Economic development agencies and entities may have funding to
contribute to projects that meet local job creation or business engagement goals.

Combining all these actors into a financing package keyed to a natural infrastructure project may be less
straightforward than the pathway to traditional bond issuance and is certainly more complicated than simple cash
pay-go approaches to capital improvements. Where simpler approaches to making investments in infrastructure
are available, it’s likely best for an agency to pursue those avenues. However, private finance can unstick projects
long deferred in the wait for traditional finance opportunities or for capital improvement budgets to finally
provide enough cash. Private finance can also deliver projects that are larger in scale and have beneficial
outcomes than can be supported with annual grant or budget cycles. It can be useful to look at the financing
structures adopted by existing private investment models to better understand the interplay between investors,
payors, and beneficiaries.

In 2017, Quantified Ventures and the District of Columbia’s Department of Water and Sewer (DC Water) launched
the nation’s first environmental impact bond focused on implementing green infrastructure to reduce sewage
overflows and flooding.[^3] This outcomes-based investment package tied the rate investors earned to the
achievement of specified environmental performance goals. The investment package structure linked DC Water
to private bond buyers. The structure used by Quantified Ventures, DC Water, and their investors follows the
track illustrated below. Noteworthy in this outcomes-based repayment scheme is the role of the third-party
evaluator. Five years after launching the project, the evaluator confirmed that stormwater runoff had been
reduced by nearly 20%, a level that met the bond’s base-level repayment criteria.[^4]

Blue Forest Conservation’s Forest Resilience Bond adopts a somewhat different approach. The Bond, more of a
revolving loan instrument, is not strictly speaking an outcomes-based financing strategy. The payor for the
project, Yuba Water Agency, makes payments to investors that are not linked to achieving any of the project’s
many benefits. The structure adopted by Blue Forest enables the creation of a portfolio of investors and funders
who repay and complement the Agency’s funding.

In the above diagram, the investors (Calvert Impact Capital, AAA Insurance, and others) provide up-front capital
by paying into the Forest Resilience Bond. This aggregate fund, administered by the National Forest Foundation,
pays contractors and local NGOs to plan and deliver forest and watershed restoration activities. Once completed,
Yuba Water Agency (the beneficiary) repays implementation costs to the fund, which repays the investors.


## Additional Case Studies

In addition to the three examples mentioned above, other experiences with innovative private financing
showcase the flexibility and appeal of these strategies.

> Corvias, a leading developer of private-public partnerships, built on its success in Prince George’s County,
MD, with the launch of the Fresh Coast Protection Program with the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage
District. Through this program, the partnership secured $75 million in financing, providing resources that
will enable Corvias to design and construct green infrastructure projects that will help MMSD meet its
regulatory goals. The outcomes-based partnership commits the District to pay a fixed cost per gallon to
Corvias, with the ultimate target of installing 8.45 million gallons of stormwater retention capacity.
 Several municipalities in California pioneered Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts to leverage the
value of infrastructure improvements as the collateral for obtaining the resources to implement these
projects.[^5] Using a technique also referred to as tax increment financing, this approach allows water
agencies and municipal governments to issue bond debt for projects that will be repaid by future
increases in property tax revenue.

These examples show the possibilities and benefits of creative strategies that bring private capital to support
water infrastructure projects.[^6] Nevertheless, there are exceptions to the normal pathways that water agencies
and municipal governments take to finance such projects. There are some challenges to securing private finance
that have stymied broader acceptance of this approach – and more effort is needed to understand and reduce
the impact of these obstacles. Institutions like the Conservation Finance Network are commendable resources for
cultivating knowledge about financing, highlighting best practices, , and generally sharing notable experiences
with a wide audience.

This is not to say that pursuing these approaches to private finance is challenge-free. Some of the costs and
challenges will be familiar to public utilities that already have experience with bond preparation and issuance for
capital projects. Considering outcomes-based finance or similar approaches adds some new issues: lack of
familiarity and capacity, uncertainty about how to best measure outcomes, lack of established networks between
utilities and investors are but a few. The authors of this paper discuss significant impediments, and pathways to
reduce them, in a separate issue brief.
