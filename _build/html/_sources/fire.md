# Tinderbox to Treatment

**Leveraging forest restoration funds**


----
## FIRE

In April 2015, I drove up highway 50 in American River Canyon to the Horsetail Falls trailhead to climb Pyramid Peak. There were still patches of snow on the ground, and the water coming down the falls was gushing, making for scenic views up the narrow canyon. While still hiking up through the mixed conifer stands on the trail, I noticed how dense the forest was with small-diameter trees. I left the trailhead briefly, walked through the pines and firs, and was struck by the excessive accumulation of downed wood in the understory. It was scary and surprisingly dry for this point in the spring. These conditions were due to a century of fire suppression, which created a high chance of burning soon, severely altering the picturesque canyon. A similar pattern exists in nearly every forested system of the Sierra Nevada mountains.

Reducing these harmful conditions will require forest health and restoration solutions that integrate communities, infrastructure, ecological thinning, and responsible biomass utilization are critical to reducing the negative impacts that unhealthy forested systems pose. Addressing unnatural conditions due to past forest and fire management regimes is a massive undertaking, already garnering billions of dollars from state and federal resources and countless organizational resources. However, it is challenging to get to the scale needed due to localized environmental conditions, organizational capacity, environmental compliance, and funding.[^1]

## Theory of change

Together with partners and a literature review, we created a simplified situation model connecting uncharacteristic fire results from fire suppression on public and private lands exacerbated by climate change (Figure 1).[^2] To enable solutions that effectively address these challenges, we then linked interventions, interim results, and outcomes (Figure 2). The treatments identified in the results chain focus on local-level interventions such as thinning, biomass utilization, and prescribed fire.[^3] Although based on a widely agreed upon forest restoration interventions, the models explicitly show the links between wildfire, forest health and beneficial outcomes.

## SOLUTIONS

Walking the talk and progressing from models to solutions is a significant hurdle, especially at the landscape scale. Proposed solutions to reduce the negative impacts of wildfires generally fall into three buckets: funding,
scaling, and capacity, although each local situation is nuanced and contains different approaches.

## Funding

Substantial state and federal funds are available for forest health projects. California is investing in forest
health, betting that increased funding for thinning, prescribed fire, wood processing infrastructure, and
businesses development projects will reduce wildfires. This increase in funding, capacity, and resources is part
of an all-hands-on-deck approach to address forest health throughout California. However, public funds
cannot cover all project needs. Furthermore, engaging the private sector is critical to meeting the challenge.
How can public dollars be maximized to reduce wildfire risk while restoring forested stands after a fire?

A potential funding solution is to leverage and complement public funds with private capital, increasing the
number of projects that return an investment to investors once meeting predetermined outcomes. Two
innovative finance approaches examples include

- The recently launched $25 million Yuba II Forest Resilience Bond on the Tahoe National Forest to
    restore 48,000 acres. Eli Ilano, Tahoe Forest Supervisor, said that the bond “...will help us finance
    prevention strategies to stave off the ever-present risk of catastrophic wildfire that can damage
    national forests and our neighboring lands.”
- The Southwest Wildfire Impact Fund takes a similar revolving loan fund approach to foster regional
    restoration across public and private land in the San Juan National Forest. The fund is capitalized by a
    combination of bond proceeds, grants, and appropriations, disbursing loans to landowners annually to
    pay for forest health treatments.

Blended, non-traditional funding strategies such as these have three distinct advantages to traditional grants
and loans: shift risk from project implementers/agencies to investors; provide funding faster by providing
capital to implementers at project start rather than reimbursement-driven grants; and create new
funding sources where funding may be scarce or not enough to address the problem at hand fully.

One critical barrier to developing non-traditional finance is the lack of payors, or the entities that repay initial
restoration investments, ideally with a modest return. For example, the Yuba Water Agency pays investors in
the Yuba II Forest Resilience Bond when predetermined outcomes related to watershed forest health and
sedimentation reduction projects are reached following project implementation and validation. Please see the
collaborative finance white paper Because It’s Worth It for a full description of payors and impact bonds.

### Scale

Following the Caldor Fire that burned large proportions of the American River Canyon, CAL FIRE awarded the El Dorado Resource Conservation District (RCD) funding as part of a coordinated and centralized Emergency Forest Restoration Team to prioritize post-fire restoration projects. A similar effort is underway following the Dixie Fire on the Plumas and Lassen National Forests and is helping to create cost and time efficiencies over large landscapes.

Other strategies for scaling efforts may include outreach to support stakeholder understanding of the broader
forest system, go beyond localized thinking, and consider how to replicate pilots through local solutions and
policy-based regional solutions ([Salafsky et al., 2021](https://stapgef.org/sites/default/files/2021-06/Taking%20Nature%20Based%20Solutions%20to%20Scale%202021-01.pdf)). At a vast scale, the Forest Service’s newly released
Confronting the Wildfire Crisis Plan aims to treat up to 20 million acres of National Forest Lands and 30 million
acres on other federal, Tribal, State, and private lands with partners ([USFS, 2022](https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/Confronting-Wildfire-Crisis.pdf). By increasing the scale of
this work, other factors such as ecological function, biodiversity, ecosystem services, climate adaptation,
socio-cultural equity, and human well-being factors are more relevant ([Schuster et al.,
2022](https://sustainableeconomiesconsulting.com/top-barriers-for-nonprofits-aiming-to-increase-their-impact-on-nature-and-human-well-being/)).

## Capacity

Building a workforce that can ably plan integrated projects, develop creative financing solutions, implement the needed array of forest treatments, utilize the removed biomass, safely apply prescribed fire, and measure the outcomes is part of a fire and finance effort. Increasing local capacity is critical for scaling efforts to restore forests following fire and build more resilient rural communities. Capacity building is not possible without community-based qualified personnel and a sustainable, ecologically sound forest health economy.

Huge strides are being made through coordination at the state and local levels. CAL FIRE’s Wood Products and Bioenergy Program has an open request for proposals that is both funding wood products businesses and building capacity. We can solve multi-disciplinary challenges to implementing forest restoration, energy, safety, and equity by bringing together best practices and methods from various disciplines. Healthier and more resilient forest ecosystems will result from identifying the relationships between the issues and barriers
to increased pace and scale and offering integrated approaches. Testing and refining pilot efforts will be an
essential part of the learning process and ensuring we meet social and ecological goals.

Training a workforce to work in the woods is a critical current and future need. Many community colleges are
creating programs to address this for work as varies as forestry to truck driving. For example, Lake Tahoe
Community College started a forestry program teaming with the California Conservation Corps and local
agencies, and Shasta College has an associate in science degree in forest science and technology. 

>“The CCC’s partnership with education institutions is extraordinarily beneficial and one we aim to replicate across the state,” said CCC Director Bruce Saito. “It’s a huge benefit to our Corpsmembers, who get exposure to college and degree programs that can help them launch great paying and meaningful careers in forestry and other fields. Together we’re helping develop a highly-trained workforce.”

## PARTING THOUGHTS

Capacity, scale, and funding will not be the only items needed to change California and the West’s wildfire situation. Policy change, community health, increased private sector engagement, and more diversified equity and cultural approaches are needed to surmount this life-threatening situation. Volatile forest conditions will not change overnight, but perhaps future disasters can be avoided by considering how existing and new
approaches to mitigate adverse conditions can be exponentially ramped up and coordinated throughout the Western United States.
