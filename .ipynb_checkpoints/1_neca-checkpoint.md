# Funding

## Summary
The JPA finance chapter is a strategy to secure sustainable funding for the proposed Northeast California biomass supply management joint powers authority (JPA) created to improve forest product supply chain bottlenecks. Developing and creating the JPA is part of the Office of Planning and Research (OPR) funded California Forest Residual Aggregation for Market Enhancement (CAL FRAME) pilot in the northeast corner of the state. See the Introduction for more information on CAL FRAME and Chapter 2 for a summary of the CLERE Inc. [JPA Report](http://gg.gg/1a0lji) report to the Fall River Resource Conservation District.

Partners developing the JPA are clear in the role of the organization acting as a critical wood utilization entity, but that it would not compete for funds with other organizations, especially RCDs or markets with private entities such as sawmills and licensed timber operators (LTOs). The approach outlined in this chapter takes a realistic, feasible assessment of revenue appropriate for the region and provides a hypothetical operating budget for running the JPA during the first five years of startup. Creating a stably funded JPA will be challenging with widely fluctuating changes in private and public funds.

## Recommendations
1. Distinguish between start-up vs. operational funds.
2. Consider budget ramping
3. Tie expenses to realistic revenues
4. Consider temporal addition of non-traditional or higher risk revenue sources, but pilot them at a small scale first, then ramp up with success.


## Feasible Options
The JPA steering committee identified the following options as the most promising to provide a steady income stream to run the JPA:

1. **Endowment**. Create an endowment from the OPR funding tranche (plus other contributions) and invest it conservatively. Interest/gains from the principal fund the JPA. We have assumed the seed funding for the JPA is \$2 mn from OPR with an additional $500,000 from foundation, corporate, and individual contributions.
2. **Contributions/gifts**. Although the McConnell Foundation is an eventual, not immediate donor, casting a wider net at the state or Western Region level for foundations, corporations, and individuals that could give to the JPA is warranted. We suggest that rather than thinking of the contributions as grants to support the JPA, the Pilot Project Team consider creating a campaign with a specific fundraising amount to start. This approach will make it easier to approach each donor with a specific amount to ask, make donors part of the overall campaign, and make smaller contributions from individuals meaningful and possible. We also recommend that initial contributions go to endowment creation.
3. **Federal and State Grants**. It is unlikely that the JPA will get operational funding from state and fed grants, but any proposals that it leads or participates in could charge overhead (usually 10-15%) plus directly bill salaries to cover some operating costs. NICRA. Business grants, SBC, and recent IRA funding.
4. **Member Contributions**. RCD and other feedstock aggregation members pay \$5k/yr to participate in the program. This would be unrestricted funding for the JPA.
5. **Fee for Service**. Western Shasta RCD, for example, works with nonindustrial forest owners and provides services for forest management plans with small forested LOs (The State funds the development of FMPs, but landowners cannot secure funds to implement the plans). JPA could create a similar service offering. However, it needs to make sure it's not competing with other RCDs in the region.
6. **Sort yards**. See page 6 highlights for costs. Need to do a feasibility study for this to work.

## Temporal Adoption
In general the feasible options identified are traditional and similar to funding approaches for an RCD or nonprofit. 

1. New finance options, such as environmental impact bonds, could be introduced over a longer time period and trialed at a small scale, then scale up when successful. These could also be other finance mechanisms such as revolving loan funds (with low-interest loans), public-private partnerships, or bonds.
2. Other revenue-generating options could be tested in the same manner to ensure their effectiveness and introduce them to skeptical participants, financial managers, or government entities that are not used to working with alternative finance options.
3. Testing, adoption, and implementation of temporal finance mechanisms is included in the GANTT chart (Figure XX)
  
## Budget
CAL FRAME partners estimated an approximate annual budget of \$300,000 based on similar operating expenses for RCDs in the region (Table 1). A detailed line item budget can be found in Appendix 1.

### Revenue
The revenue amounts are highly on a startup endowment of \$1 million, regular indirect costs to cover operating from grants, and significant fee-for-service to forest landowners and possibly fees charged for use of wood from a sort yard. Ideally, the goal would be to get to a stable revenue source to at least cover staff salaries and most operational costs. It may be that a multi-year campaign is needed to get to a minimum level (\$2 million is suggested since that could generate \$100,000 annually as an endowment).

### Expenses
JPA partners estimated an annual expense budget of \$300,000. This annual expense budget may be thought of as a long-term sustainable budget. In other words, the JPA would not start with a $300,000 budget, rather it may be as much as 1/3 lower than this, likely with fewer staff, then ramp up towards a fully operational targeted amount.

## Timeline
Add an implementation GANTT chart for timing staff, sort yards, and rental/other expenses

## Next steps
1. Refine the revenue and expense numbers
2. Consider a feasibility study to determine revenue from realistic to moon-shot possibilities.
3. Will add more...
