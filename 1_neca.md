# JPA Finance

## Summary
The JPA finance chapter is a strategy to secure sustainable funding for the proposed Northeast California biomass supply management joint powers authority (JPA) created to improve forest product supply chain bottlenecks. Developing and creating the JPa is part of the Office of Planning and Research (OPR) funded California Forest Residual Aggregation for Market Enhancement (CAL FRAME) pilot in the northeast corner of the state. See the Introduction for more information on CAL FRAME and Chapter 2 for a summary of the CLERE Inc. [JPA Report](http://gg.gg/1a0lji) report to the Fall River Resource Conservation District.

Partners developing the JPA are clear in the role of the organization acting as a critical wood utilization entity, but that it would not compete for funds with other organizations, especially RCDs or markets with private entitities such as sawmills and licensed timber operators (LTOs). The approach outlined in this chapter takes a realistic, feasible assessment of revenue appropriate for the region and provides a hypothetical operating budget for running the JPA during the first five years of startup. With widely fluctuating changes in private and public funds, creating a stably funded JPA will be challenging.

Key findings and challenges:

1. List these once the paper and budget are drafted


## Realistic options

1. **Endowment**. Create an endowment from OPR funding tranche (plus other contributions) invest it conservatively. Interest/gains from the principal fund the JPA. We have assumed the seed funding for the JPA is \$2 mn from OPR with an additional $500,000 from foundation, corporate, and individual contributions.
2. **Contributions**. Although the McConnell Foundation is an eventual, not immediate donor, casting a wider net at the state or Western Region level for foundations, corporations, and individuals that could give to the JPA is warranted. We suggest that rather than thinking of the contributions as grants to support the JPA, the Pilot Project Team consider creating a campaign with a specific fundraising amount to start. This approach will make it easier to approach each donor with a specific amount to ask, make donors part of the overall campaign, and make smaller contribution from individuals meaningful and possible. We also recommend that initial contributions go to endowment creation.
3. **Federal and State Grants**. Unlikely that the JPA will get operational funding from state and fed grants, but any proposals that it leads or participates in, could charge overhead (usually 10-15%) plus directly bill salaries to cover some operating costs. NICRA. Business grants, SBC, and recent IRA funding.
4. **Member Contributions**. RCD and other feedstock aggregation members pay $5k/yr to participate in the program. This would be unrestricted funding for the JPA.
5. **Fee for Service**. Example of Western Shasta RCD work with nonindustrial forest owners, provide services for forest mgmt plans with small forested LOs (The State funds the development of FMPs, but landowners cannot secure funds to implement the plans). JPA could create a similar service offering. Need to make sure it's not competing with other RCDs in the region.
6. **Sort yards**. See pag 6 highlights for costs. Need to do a feasibliity study for this to work.

## Temporal Adoption

1. New finance options, such as environmental impact bonds, could be introduced over a longer time-period and trialed at a small scale, then scale up when successful.
2. Other revenue generating options could be tested in the same manner to make sure they work and also introduce them to skeptical participants, financial managers, or government entities that are not used to working with alternative finance options.
  
## Hypothetical budget

1. Todd spitballed a budget of $300k/yr based on similar operating expenses for RCDs in the region.
2. It could be with lower costs due to the JPA isn't initially managing projects like the RCDs are possible.
3. Provide a budget example and discuss potential shortfalls or gaps.
4. Insurance costs at <3% of budget
