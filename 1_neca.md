# Funding

## Summary
The JPA finance chapter is a strategy to secure sustainable funding for the proposed Northeast California biomass supply management joint powers authority (JPA) created to improve forest product supply chain bottlenecks. Developing and creating the JPA is part of the Office of Planning and Research (OPR) funded California Forest Residual Aggregation for Market Enhancement (CAL FRAME) pilot in the northeast corner of the state. See the Introduction for more information on CAL FRAME and Chapter 2 for a summary of the CLERE Inc. [JPA Report](http://gg.gg/1a0lji) report to the Fall River Resource Conservation District.

Partners developing the JPA are clear in the role of the organization acting as a critical wood utilization entity, but that it would not compete for funds with other organizations, especially RCDs or markets with private entities such as sawmills and licensed timber operators (LTOs). The approach outlined in this chapter takes a realistic, feasible assessment of revenue appropriate for the region and provides a hypothetical operating budget for running the JPA during the first five years of startup. Creating a stably funded JPA will be challenging with widely fluctuating changes in private and public funds.

## Recommendations
1. Distinguish between start-up vs. operational funds.
2. Consider budget ramping
3. Tie expenses to realistic revenues
4. Consider temporal addition of non-traditional or higher risk revenue sources, but pilot them at a small scale first, then ramp up with success.


## Feasible Options
The JPA steering committee identified the following options as the most promising to provide a steady income stream to run the JPA:

1. **Endowment**. Create an endowment from the OPR funding tranche (plus other contributions) and invest it conservatively. Interest/gains from the principal fund the JPA. We have assumed the seed funding for the JPA is \$2 mn from OPR with an additional $500,000 from foundation, corporate, and individual contributions.
2. **Contributions/gifts**. Although the McConnell Foundation is an eventual, not immediate donor, casting a wider net at the state or Western Region level for foundations, corporations, and individuals that could give to the JPA is warranted. We suggest that rather than thinking of the contributions as grants to support the JPA, the Pilot Project Team consider creating a campaign with a specific fundraising amount to start. This approach will make it easier to approach each donor with a specific amount to ask, make donors part of the overall campaign, and make smaller contributions from individuals meaningful and possible. We also recommend that initial contributions go to endowment creation.
3. **Federal and State Grants**. It is unlikely that the JPA will get operational funding from state and fed grants, but any proposals that it leads or participates in could charge overhead (usually 10-15%) plus directly bill salaries to cover some operating costs. NICRA. Business grants, SBC, and recent IRA funding.
4. **Member Contributions**. RCD and other feedstock aggregation members pay \$5k/yr to participate in the program. This would be unrestricted funding for the JPA.
5. **Fee for Service**. Western Shasta RCD, for example, works with nonindustrial forest owners and provides services for forest management plans with small forested LOs (The State funds the development of FMPs, but landowners cannot secure funds to implement the plans). JPA could create a similar service offering. However, it must ensure it's not competing with other RCDs in the region.
6. **Sort yards**. See page 6 highlights for costs. Need to do a feasibility study for this to work.

## Temporal Adoption
In general the feasible options identified are traditional and similar to funding approaches for an RCD or nonprofit. 

1. New finance options, such as environmental impact bonds, could be introduced over a longer time period and trialed at a small scale, then scale up when successful. These could also be other finance mechanisms such as revolving loan funds (with low-interest loans), public-private partnerships, or bonds.
2. Other revenue-generating options could be tested in the same manner to ensure their effectiveness and introduce them to skeptical participants, financial managers, or government entities that are not used to working with alternative finance options.
3. Testing, adoption, and implementation of temporal finance mechanisms is included in the GANTT chart (Figure XX)
  
## Budget
CAL FRAME partners estimated an approximate annual budget of \$300,000 based on similar operating expenses for RCDs in the region {numref}`summary`. A detailed line item budget can be found in {ref}`appendix1`.

```

### Revenue
The revenue amounts are based on a startup endowment of \$1 million, regular indirect costs to cover operating from grants, and significant fee-for-service to forest landowners and possibly fees charged for use of wood from a sort yard. Ideally, the goal would be a stable revenue source to cover staff salaries and operational costs. It may be that a multi-year campaign is needed to get to a minimum level (\$2 million is suggested since that could generate ~\$100,000 annually as an endowment). We've made a conservative estimate for the startup endowment, but it's possible the number may be higher but likely not more than double the estimate, e.g., \$2 mn.

Contributions includes endowment, passive income, gifts, and member contributions. Contributions and gifts may come from local to regional foundations and from corporations that have an interest in the forest health world. Individual contributions always have the potential to add up to more than foundation and corporate gifts but take more time to manage. Creating a time-bound campaign with a specific fundraising goal replete with a thermometer to show progress could be a great way to involve communities in the region through giving and creating outreach or communications opportunities at the same time to explain the need for the JPA and the importance of sustainable funding from the community to protect homes, infrastructure, and forests.

Revenue may also be derived from the feedstock supply insurance product currently being developed by members of the CAL FRAME team and Ecostrat. Approximately half of the startup funding could fund this mechanism or a parametric insurance model. These are in process so more details will be provided once ready.

Grants in the budget will not compete with the RCDs. RCDs are reliant on grants from various sources to carry out their work, cover staff salaries, and keep the lights on at the office. Grant resources are limited, so a new entity such as the JPA cannot compete for those funds in any way.

On the other hand, the JPA may help administer a large grant across multiple RCDs in order to leverage more funds across a region. With the devolution of some state funding sources, this could be a great option to manage those funds and reduce the competition for funding resources since the grants solely go to local organizations. The fee-for-service section includes an item for grant administration. It also includes an option for implementing landowner forest plans not only since this may be a viable revenue source but it may help to source wood for the JPA. A sort yard that the JPA manages to source, centralize, and sell woody biomass is another revenue option but will require investment to be successful. Expenses for the sort yard are included in the expenses section.

```{caution}
It is critical to incorporate into the JPA's bylaws and revenue-generating practices that grant fundraising does not compete with the RCDs in the region. It is possible the JPA may collaborate on a grant with one or more RCDs but should never submit grants for which an RCD qualifies.
```

### Expenses
JPA partners originally estimated an annual expense budget of ~\$ $300,000, but the annual budget average is ~\$230,000. The total expenses/year slowly ramp up each year of the budget with the idea that with additional secured revenue, the JPA would bring on more staff capacity and increase offerings, reach, or fee-for-service activities such as additional sort yards.

The bulk of the expenses are for labor/staff that includes an executive director, contracted feedstock manager, administrative bookkeeper, and various contracted services. Very briefly, the staff responsibilities are the following:

- **Executive Director**. Manage board of directors, lead program development/outreach/education/fundraising/communications, develop an annual budget, manage contracts, recruit and manage staff.
—**Administrative Bookkeeper**. Track/invoice budget, develop cost allocation plan, manage grant reporting, administer payroll, manage AP/AR accounts, prepare 1099s and tax docs, develop grant budgets, and ensure financial compliance.
—**Feedstock Manager**. Source and sell feedstock from public and private lands, arrange transport to sort yard(s), manage sort yards, develop outreach materials, manage compliance documents for sort yard and aggregation, and maintain records.

Other expenses include operations and maintenance as detailed in {ref}`appendix1`, such as filing fees, audit/legal fees, insurance, equipment, software, travel, and bank fees. Expenses also include communications, website, and outreach and equipment, insurance, land lease costs for a sort yard.

## Timeline
An approximate timeline for key activities to fund and operationalize the JPA is shown in {numref}`gantt`. Endowment seed funding and a capital campaign will be critical to initiate the endowment. Staffing is described under expenses and shows the approximate start time for each staff member. Governance will be defined by the development of the JPA bylaws, and the JPA will created when the LAFCO filing is completed.

## Next steps
1. Refine the revenue and expense numbers with RCDs and the JPA core team.
2. Consider a feasibility study to determine revenue from realistic to moon-shot possibilities.
3. Examine insurance requirements and costs
4. Add detail to the timeline
