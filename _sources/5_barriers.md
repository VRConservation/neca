## Barriers. Obstacles. Challenges.

The pathway to adopting an outcomes-based financing solution has promise for many natural infrastructure
projects, but it is paved with many barriers, obstacles, and challenges. Understanding these, and discerning
between the challenges that can be addressed, obstacles that can be reduced, and barriers that need to be
avoided, can be critically important for the local proponents of any project.

While there is considerable enthusiasm for scaling the application of collaborative finance[^1] across the water
sector, there has not been commensurate movement to apply these strategies to actual projects. Despite the
pioneering work of key non-traditional finance champions (e.g., Quantified Ventures, Blue Forest Conservation,
and Corvias), application mostly has been limited to several high-pr ofile pilot or demonstration projects, often
supported by philanthropic foundations. As interest in these innovative finance strategies expands, water
agencies, land managers, and others interested in accessing new finance mechanisms can benefit from frank
reflection on the factors that have frustrated widespread adoption.

In our conversations with financing experts and project developers who have opted to pursue collaborative
finance approaches, we’ve come to recognize three types of challenges that have an outsized effect on
successfully securing financing:

## Securing Project Payors

- Infrastructure investments, including nature-based approaches, typically need a public agency to be the
    primary responsible payor. Spending by these agencies is most effectively motivated by the need to meet
    a regulatory or other mandate. Even then, statutory, or regulatory restrictions may limit the types of
    infrastructure in which an agency may invest.

## Understanding and Allocating Acceptable Levels of Risk

- There is low institutional tolerance for risk in the collaborative finance arena, meaning that resolving real
    or perceived risk can be a significant challenge to adopting unfamiliar technologies or finance
    mechanisms. Supporters of a project need to consider the tolerance for risk that each stakeholder has,
    and design both the project and financing in ways that satisfactorily address those risk perceptions. For
    example, a stormwater management agency may be reluctant to invest in a comprehensive green
    infrastructure program because it isn’t sure that the associated projects will meet its regulatory
    obligations and the private-public partnership being suggested to implement the program is an unfamiliar
    approach to contracting. A pay-for-performance structure that ties repayment to achievement of
    specified water quality goals or volume of stormwater treated may be a step toward overcoming the
    agency’s resistance.

## Identifying and Measuring Outcomes

- When the structure of a financing arrangement is focused on delivery of a project’s outcomes, it becomes
    crucially important to identify and measure these outcomes in manners that speak to the concerns of the
    payor agency. Outcome measurement, and communication about outcomes, must be responsive to
    agency input and concerns, rather than pulled from a standard template. Metrics that are accepted across the collaborative stakeholder group can help with aligning interests and investments.

While described here as separate issues, they are actually closely intertwined. Resolving one may require the
project’s proponents and stakeholders to consider and address all three. For example, a water supply or flood
control district may be the ideal payor for a restoration project but convincing its board and staff to allocate funds
may require reducing the risk they perceive in either the project, the financing strategy, or both. In turn, this
perception of risk may be due to uncertainty about the delivery of benefits that align with the district’s mission or
long-term strategies. Identifying ways to quantify the benefits that the district cares about may be a pathway to
gaining its support.

In addition to these core concerns, there are other challenges that often arise, many of which are not unique to
collaborative financing strategies. Opting to pursue collaborative finance doesn’t erase any of these challenges
and so project stakeholders are advised to consider them in designing both the project and the financing strategy.

## Funding

- Repayment revenue. Perennially a limitation on water infrastructure projects, collaborative finance
    strategies also depend on identifiable, sustainable revenue streams that can be allocated to repayment of
    debt obligations. The expectation is that at least some investment repayment will come from the
    sponsoring/payor agency; an advantage of collaborative finance approaches is that multiple repayment streams may be assembled.

- Funding limitations. State or federal grant or loan programs can be important components of a portfolio
    of repayment funds. However, these programs often have restrictions that limit their applicability, for

**example, barring repayment of interest on private investments.**

## Sociopolitical Challenges

- Lack of familiarity. Collaborative finance strategies involve outcomes-based or other non-traditional financing structures which are frequently unfamiliar to typical project proponents and developers.

- Capacity. Capacity of organizations involved to create, manage, and fundraise is uneven across municipal
    and water sectors. Public agency finance staff may be reluctant to buy into these approaches or lack fundamental understanding about them.

- Natural Infrastructure as add-on. For many public agencies, nature-based alternatives and green
    infrastructure are considered add-ons and funded through pay-as-you-go (paygo) strategies based on
    annual operating budgets. This limitation is reinforced by governing boards and accounting systems that have difficulty accommodating revenues other than traditional grants, loans, and water sales.

- Debt. Many public agencies are unwilling to incur debt for natural infrastructure projects. Widespread
    preference for cash-basis funding and, general or reserve funds and federal and state grants and loans limits appetite for financing strategies.

- Trust. Successfully developing and deploying an outcomes-based financing method requires collaboration
    between a range of stakeholders. Unless there is positive history between these entities and individuals, progress may be frustrated by lack of comfort, lack of trust, and lack of familiarity.

## Finance-related

- Avoided Cost Basis. Difficulties in quantifying avoided infrastructure and maintenance costs lead to unwillingness/impossibility of using this basis for project approval and financing.

- Predevelopment Costs. The cost of feasibility studies and pre-transaction development may be high
    relative to other infrastructure projects. It can be a high bar for many communities and organizations to raise planning/feasibility funds just to start the process.

- Finance networks. There are few established networks for connecting financiers to municipalities and
    water agencies. Investors are unaware of emerging project needs and opportunities, and water project developers are disconnected from relevant investment sources.

## Getting Beyond No

While this roster of potential impediments may seem daunting, most can be reduced through a well-conceived
and managed collaborative strategy. It may be helpful to focus on a trio of core themes running through many of
the looming challenges:

- Identify beneficiaries/potential revenue streams. Accessing private capital will require a solid business
    case underpinned by identifiable, reliable revenue sources to provide an attractive risk-adjusted return to
    investors. It may be important to convert some project beneficiaries from “free loaders” to payors. In
    most cases, an entity (or entities) with a strong regulatory or economic driver will likely be the key payors for the project, bearing ultimate responsibility for repayment of investors.

- Create consistent, agreed-upon metrics. Universally accepted metrics may not be suitable for every individual project. Some, like the Volumetric Water Benefit Accounting method developed by the World
    Resources Institute, may be useful, but often the metrics for evaluating success must be identified by the
    project partners, and should be responsive to the risks and values that payors and investors bring with
    them. In addition, metrics should reflect the regulatory, economic, environmental, or economic forces that drive the project.

- Value broad-based political and community support. Building a coalition of support across the political
    and societal landscape is key to implementing collaboratively financed projects. This support can translate
    into widespread buy-in and multi-faceted financing.

## Resolving Challenges in Real Time

With this short catalogue of potential resolutions in hand, let’s explore how these themes come into play across
the various stages of project’s timespan. With careful planning, deep engagement across the stakeholders, and
some creativity these challenges can be overcome.

## Conceptual Stage

It can be valuable to identify potential financing strategies even at the earliest stages in the development of an
eventual project, when the initial stakeholders have identified a problem in need of a solution but haven’t yet
clarified what that solution may be. However, at this point, it’s likely that few stakeholders will have a working
grasp of outcomes-based approaches that may be relevant. Some foundation-laying education may be important,
including introductory level presentations by outside experts. This level of engagement can help to socialize
available concepts within the stakeholder group and begin building relationships with potential partners and
finance providers.

## Project Identification/Design

As the project advances to a preliminary design stage, discussions amongst the stakeholders should turn to
identifying the intended outcomes of the project, including co-benefits. These outcomes can be linked to the
mission or values of one or more stakeholders and may be the basis for financial investment in the project. At the
same time, it can be helpful to agree upon metrics that indicate successful realization of the desired outcomes
and evaluation strategies that can provide an acceptable measurement of the outcomes and benefits.

## Advancing the Project: Role Assignment

With project design and desired outcomes/benefits in hand, a stakeholder group may turn to identifying likely
payors and investors in the project. Noting the difference in these roles. Payors are entities that agree to
contribute funding without expectation of repayment, e.g., a water utility or special district with a regulatory
obligation linked to a project outcome. Investors, on the other hand, may be motivated by one or more of the
project’s benefits to provide funding but with an expectation of repayment. This repayment may or may not
include some amount of interest in addition to the amount of capital provided.

## Project Implementation

As the project moves into implementation, a credible, neutral third party may be brought on as a project
administrator / implementation manager. Engaging a third party can not only relieve the payor(s) of daily
implementation burdens but may be able to provide or locate financing for the project. For example, some public-
private partnerships are built around project developers who not only undertake implementation tasks but
deliver project finance.[^2] Bringing in a trusted implementation partner can reduce some of the risks otherwise
carried by the public utilities leading the project by providing cost-effective, expert project management.

## Evaluation and Communication

Finally, as the project begins to deliver benefits, reach agreed upon milestones, or is completed, a trusted
evaluator can ascertain whether metrics are being met and outcomes-based payments are appropriate. Credible
evaluation reduces risks for the payor and investors and is also valuable in providing information to help
communicate the value of the project to all stakeholders.

## Concluding Thoughts

As the cliché goes, the flip-side of challenges are opportunities. Collaborative finance approaches can deliver a
range of administrative, economic and environmental benefits to communities, public agencies, and watersheds.
These benefits include the ability to implement projects more quickly and at landscape scale, cost-effective
implementation of nature-based infrastructure, and delivery of outcomes rather than payment for project
completion. While the challenges described above may seem unsurmountable, the very process of collaboration
that lies at the heart of these non-traditional financing strategies may hold the keys to success.

This paper focuses on the challenges and obstacles that project stakeholders may encounter within their own,
localized pathway from concept to project delivery. At the same time, the broader project finance community has
its own work to do to acknowledge the existing barriers that have frustrated wider embrace of outcomes-based
private investment in water infrastructure. A number of recent publications have explored this subject and are
worth reviewing for those interested in advancing local projects.[^3] Experience tells us that it often takes multiple
avenues of action to bring new innovations to fruition. The compelling pressures of accelerating need for
investment in resilient communities and water systems couple with stretched public budgets makes the case of
resolving challenges to ‘innovative’ financing.

## Collaborative Finance Series

This finance barriers blog is part three of a series of blogs on collaborative finance. Part one, Finding the Pathway
outlines the steps to collaborative finance. In part two of the series, we provide a primer on alternative
approaches to project finance. Future papers will explore solutions to barriers facing collaborative finance and
strategies to leverage public grants and loans to secure private investment. A more complete discussion of these
strategies can be found in the American Rivers’ report Because It’s Worth It.

[^1]: Collaborative finance is an approach to developing financial instruments which involves cooperative interaction between individual project developers, stakeholders and finance providers. This process may or may not include traditional financial institutions ([collaborativefinance.org](https://www.collaborativefinance.org/)). We broaden the term to include finance developed by fair and equitable participation of stakeholders in a region, landscape, or watershed to address natural resource and infrastructure management needs, utilizing multiple forms of funding from public grants to private investment. Finance approaches may include outcomes-based finance models such as environmental impact bonds.
